# File-Reflection
This project uses **Clang LLVM** to reflect files and generate code to set up reflection data that exposes objects, variables and functions.  This allows a program to dynamically read and call these functions.  This is useful for scripting as data containers such as classes and structs can now be read and modified.

## Macros 

### #define REFLECT_CLASS

Tell the reflector to reflect this class. Atm the reflector reflects all classes it finds.

### #define REFLECT_FUNCTION

Tell the reflector to reflect this function. Atm the reflector reflects all public functions.

### #define REFLECT_VARIABLE

Tell the reflector to reflect this variable. Atm the reflector reflects all public variables.

### #define REFLECT_EXCLUDE_INVOKER

To save memory by defining this, Invoke won't be included inside ReflectionVariable and ReflectionFunctions.


## Reflection

Uses Clang to reflect files and Generate reflection data with Shared Reflection Data.

## Shared_Reflection_Data

Contains code for Reflection data.

# Improvements

### Main takes in Arguments

### Reflect Code to constexpr

### Variable and Functions to pointers
